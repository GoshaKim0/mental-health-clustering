# Mental Health in Technology — Clustering Case Study

This repository contains an analytical project based on the “Mental Health in Tech 2016” dataset.  
The goal of the project is to categorize survey participants and visualize behavioral patterns related to mental health awareness and treatment among technology workers.

## Project overview
The workflow includes:
1. Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing
2. Handling missing values and encoding categorical features
3. Dimensionality reduction using PCA
4. Selection of the optimal number of clusters via silhouette analysis
5. Mixed-type clustering with K-Prototypes
6. Visualization using PCA and t-SNE
7. Profiling and interpretation of clusters
## Key findings
- Optimal number of clusters: k = 4  
- Clustering method: K-Prototypes  
- Visualizations: PCA and t-SNE projections  
- Output: four interpretable participant profiles supporting targeted recommendations
